# Task-timer

Measure the time it takes to complete your tasks. You want to know how long it has taken
you to do a certain task using your computer.

You can collect data and analyze it to see your execution performance. With these data it will
be easy to estimate your completion for future tasks.

The analysis creates reports, charts that visually help you understand the data.
You can also create todo lists and create reminders that will notify you.
